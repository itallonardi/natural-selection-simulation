# natural-selection-simulation
This project is a natural selection simulation using Pygame. Organisms move, reproduce, eat, and die in an environment with different terrain types, simulating evolution and adaptation. When reproducing, organisms pass their characteristics to offspring with variations, allowing evolution over time.
